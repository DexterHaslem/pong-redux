# pong-redux
a simple pong clone using redux for state.

some notable features:
- doesn't mutate state, uses reducers with immutable maps for all state
- hyper advanced ai
- ball that doesnt deflect at an angle!
- probably incorrect usage of redux

a live example is here: http://dexterhaslem.github.io/pong-redux/
