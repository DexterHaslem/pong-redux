# pong-redux
this crude pong clone uses redux for all state. 
See the [redux github](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) for more information on redux itself.

some notable features:
- doesn't mutate state, uses reducers with immutable maps for all state
- super hyper advanced ai
- ball that doesnt deflect at an angle!
- probably incorrect usage of redux

a live example is [here](http://dexterhaslem.github.io/pong-redux/)
